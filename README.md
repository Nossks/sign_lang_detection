# American Sign Language (ASL) Real‑Time Translator
A real-time ASL-to-text web app that uses live webcam input to detect ASL alphabet signs and builds words and sentences based on your hand gestures. Includes a Flask backend for prediction and a responsive frontend with video stream, prediction logic, word handling, and text-to-speech.

## Features
**Live ASL Recognition** via webcam.
**Prediction Stability Buffer** to ensure consistent output.
**Current Word + Sentence Builder** using space gestures.
**Text-to-Speech Support** for spoken output.
**Backspace & Clear All Controls** for easy correction.
**Static ASL Symbol Guide** for user reference.
**Collage Generator Script** for generating a labeled symbol grid from images.


## Tech Stack
**Backend**: Python, Flask, MediaPipe, pickle
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
**ML Model**: Random Forest classifier saved as `model.pkl` 
**Utilities**: hand_landmarks.py

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Nossks/sign_lang_detection
cd sign_lang_detection

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

### 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Add Your Model
Place your trained model in the project root as:
model.pkl

### 5. Symbol Images
Add a collage of all symbols

## Running the App
python app.py

Then open your browser and visit:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## How It Works
**Webcam Feed** captures your hand gesture.
**Model Prediction** detects the character (A–Z or space).
**Buffering Logic** ensures the character is consistent across multiple frames.
**"Space" Gesture** finalizes the current word and adds it to the sentence.
**Backspace** removes a letter from the current word.
**Clear All** resets the entire sentence.
**Speak** uses the browser's speech synthesis to read out the sentence.

## Future Enhancements
Implement for gesture rather than just static symbols.
Use a deep learning model like LSTM RNN for gestures instead of cpu based ml algo's.
